# Welcome to our newcomer experience

We are using this project as a step by step tutorial to our Angular working habits and conventions. The tutorial starts with the generation of an app. It handles many different aspects of Angular development and provides first experiences with our library [@prosoft/components](https://github.com/prosoft-edv/components). Tutorial steps can be found [here](https://github.com/prosoft-edv/newcomer-experience/wiki).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4600/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
